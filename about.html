A developed country is a sovereign state with a developed economy and technologically advanced
 infrastructure compared to other nations. Several factors determine whether or not a country is developed, 
 such as the Human Development Index, political stability, gross domestic product (GDP), industrialization, and freedom. 
 Countries that are not quite yet developed are called developing countries.

The Human Development Index was developed by the United Nations to measure human development in a country.
 HDI is quantified by looking at a country's human development, such as education, health, and life expectancy.
  HDI is set on a scale from 0 to 1, and most developed countries have a score above .80. HDI can be used to determine the best countries to live in, 
  as those who are more developed typically have a higher quality of life.

Developed countries have post-industrial economies with service sectors contributing more to the nation 
than the industrial sector. Because there are so many factors to consider, defining what countries are 
developed can be a challenge.

While Mexico is not considered a developed country based on its HDI rankings, some organizations believe 
it is. Mexico has a .767 HDI ranking. While the country is plagued by poverty, lack of quality health care, 
and limited access to clean water, it is considered one of the world's most advanced developing countries.

According to the UN, Turkey, a member of the EU, OECD, and G-20, has an HDI of .807, making it a developed 
country. The CIA World Factbook also classifieds Turkey as developed, while some organizations such as 
Dow Jones and FTSE classify Turkey as developing. This is likely because Turkey has a slightly high infant 
mortality rate for developed countries of 12 per 1,000, and the country's life expectancy is 75. The World 
Bank classifies Turkey as an upper-middle income country in terms of its per capita GDP.</p>
